Making an NFT collection, to put it together with our <a href="https://github.com/gab0071/whitelist-nextjs">whitelist</a> project, an overview of our project:

- There should only exist 20 Crypto Dev NFT's and each one of them should be unique.
- User's should be able to mint only 1 NFT with one transaction.
